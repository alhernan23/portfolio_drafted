                        <h1>Japantown Postcard Designs</h1>
                        <h2>Digital Collaging and Illustration, 2022</h2>
                        <p>
                            In Visual Communication I, students were to design three postcards 
                            based on a favorite place of theirs. Japantown (San Francisco) was chosen 
                            since it was a popular spot to hang out with friends back in high school. 
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            Three different styles are represented in the three postcards, reflecting 
                            a different “time era” in Japan: a traditional, city pop (1980s), and 
                            contemporary styles. Photoshop was used to put everything together, and 
                            a drawing program called Firealpaca to illustrate the lady in the second 
                            postcard. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The icons next to each title were designed from a previous Visual 
                            Communication project that required students to create icons of their favorite places in Illustrator.
                            A warm, welcoming feeling was intended for this set 
                            of postcards to reflect Japantown's welcoming environment.
                        </p>

                <h1>Typography and GIF Project</h1>
                <h2>Digital Illustration and Animation, 2022</h2>
                <p>
                    Another project in Visual Communication I was to create a poster featuring
                    typographic elements and an accompanying gif using the Photoshop feature (timeline)
                    to animate. The theme was “resistance,” and students were to choose whichever 
                    song lyrics or poetry reflected their personal definition of “resistance.” 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The song chosen, “I LOVE…” by Official Hige Dandism, is originally written 
                    in the Japanese language so the translation is included at the top engraving of the lantern
                    (and at the bottom left corner in the animated GIF). The song is about how falling in love can 
                    be scary, but exciting at the same time because being with someone can make you feel stronger.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The chosen lyrics "Kimi ga kureta purezento wa kono yakeni yasahii sekaida[yo]" translate
                    to "the present you gave to me is this awfully kind world." Lanterns were chosen to 
                    represent a spark in the darkness, a sign of hope and resistance to all things negative. 
                    The plants flourish underneath the light, representing how fighting the darkness together 
                    will bring growth and enlightenment to the world. The drawing program Firealpaca was used 
                    to illustrate, and Illustrator was used to edit typographic elements.

                <h1>Queer BIPOC Meetup Poster Design</h1>
                <h2>Digital Illustration, 2022</h2>
                <p>
                    This is a poster design for an event USF's Cultural Centers hosts, 
                    which was the Queer BIPOC community meetup. The program leader, a fellow intern, wanted to create 
                    individual characters for the other interns at the Cultural Centers and have them in a 
                    coffee shop setting (since the community meetup would be like a cafe). Cafes are typically 
                    seen as a comforting and calming environment, so a dull color palette was chosen 
                    while having characters interact with each other. Procreate was used for illustration, 
                    and Illustrator was used to add and edit the text.

                <h1>Cafe International Poster Design</h1>
                <h2>Digital Illustration, 2022</h2>
                <p>
                    This is another poster design for an event hosted by the Cultural Centers, 
                    Cafe International - an event where international students at the university 
                    can come together and talk with one another. Community and fellowship 
                    are very prominent themes for the event, since international students may 
                    feel homesick. Warm colors were chosen to represent a warm and welcoming 
                    feeling with an intimate setting of people from around the world sitting 
                    together and having coffee. Procreate was used for illustration, 
                    and Illustrator was used to add and edit text.

                <h1>Lyricist Lounge Instagram Post Design</h1>
                <h2>Digital Illustration, 2022</h2>
                <p>
                    Lyricist Lounge is an event hosted every month during the 
                    school year, where poets and writers can recite their written works to a live audience. 
                    The theme of October 2022 was “fears,” and so light sources (symbols of hope from different cultures)
                    represent that there is hope in fear and darkness. Procreate was used for illustration, and 
                    Illustrator was used to add and edit text.
