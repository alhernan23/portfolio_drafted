                <h1>Hello, I'm Ally Hernandez!</h1>
                <p>
                    I'm a second year design major and advertising minor at the University 
                    of San Francisco. I was born and raised in South SF and I've always loved going out
                    into the city to gather inspiration for my work. While I do design in my free time,
                    I also have taken art classes at my high school <a href="https://www.shcp.edu/arts/visual-arts" class="outlink">Sacred Heart Cathedral</a>
                    which is located in the heart of the city and
                    at <a href="https://artworksfineartstudio.com/" class="outlink">ArtWorks Fine Studio</a> 
                    located in West Portal. I've worked 
                    with a variety of art mediums ranging from traditional (oil pastels, oil painting, acrylic painting, color 
                    pencils, watercolor, charcoal, etc) to digital (photography, digital drawing/illustration, 
                    Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop). Most of my work has been illustration 
                    based, from my AP Studio Art portfolio to fun little personal projects like 
                    fanart. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently focusing more on my digital work as I pursue my 
                    bachelor's degree at USF and I've been experimenting with HTML and CSS coding. 
                    I'm very enthusiastic about taking on new design and art challenges to further 
                    improve my skill set! I'm interested in knowing more about different kinds of 
                    design such as industrial design, graphic design, character design, UX/UI 
                    design and more.
